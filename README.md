## Setup the project on Tekedia Server
Login to your ssh provided by Tekedia, You can use Putty or Windows Terminal, 

#### Connect to Tekedia Server
Type the following command with your username
`ssh <username>@<tekedia_server_ip_address>`

Welcome to your personal space in Tekedia Server

`cd htdocs/<domainname>`
Here `domain name` is either your custom domain or Tekedia provided domain

`cd htdocs/student.zenvus.com`

Clone the Github Repo by the command
`git clone https://github.com/Blucera/demo-winsupport.git .`

#### Making the build and Running the Container
Run the command
`podman-compose build --no-cache`
This will build your code, Installing all the dependencies required for the AI Agent to run in your personal envoirenment.

After the build is complete, We have to start the container, Before that Tekedia Institute have provided you a `port number` on which you have to run your container. We have to add the `port number` assigned by Tekedia to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

For that run
`nano docker-compose.yml`

And you will see this
```
version: "3.9"

services:
  winsupport:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "<your_port>:8501"
    environment:
      # Tell your app where to reach Ollama
      OLLAMA_HOST: http://172.17.0.1:11434
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:172.17.0.1"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Here replace `<your_port>` with the port number assigned by Tekedia. Hit `Ctrl + X`, Then `Y` then `Enter` and your file is saved.

Now you can run the command
`podman-compose up -d`

And your code is running on your domain. You can also check if the container is successfully running by typing
`podman ps` 
It will show your container.
